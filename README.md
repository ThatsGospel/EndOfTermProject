# EndOfTermProject - Neon Rage

Ben O'Quigley.

Game Design Year 3.

# Project Description:

This project uses several different "flocks" who operate independantly of each other. They avoid obstacles and stay within a radius in order to keep all spawned flock members on screen. There are several different assets withing the project which also react to music within the scene by changing size in relation to the volume of the song. It is a neon cityscape in 2D.

# Instructions for use:

Press play on the project, it is purely visual.

# How it works:

I created several flock spawners which use inherited behaviours in order to filter themselves into their individual flocks and in order to avoid obstacles. I imported assets which I then used the audiosource to affect their scale.
